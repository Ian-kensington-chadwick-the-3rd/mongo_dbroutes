## Description

mongo_dbroutes is a server-side application that uses express to route to a mongo_db database that gets, updates, adds, and deletes any user, friend, thought, and reaction.

## what I learned

* I learned how to make routes that interact with mongo db to make a working data base
* I learned how to use a different folder structure than what is usual with mySql
* I learned how to make a schema in mongo_db and how it differs from mySql
